= AppDev - Lab Overview, Environment, and Logins

== Overview
In this lab each user will be able to deploy various services that together create an Edge based shopping application that operationalizes deployed AI/ML models and applies business logic to solve business needs -- identifying and pricing a new product offering in a store or kiosk.

Each user will perform the following tasks:

* Log into OpenShift Console and view their existing AppDev (application development) project
* Install and test the Red Hat CamelK pricing engine service.
* Deploy and test the TensorFlow Serving component against an existing image detection model.
* Deploy and test the Red Hat Camel Quarkus based shopping application.
* Initiate a pipeline run for the training, building, and deployment of a new image detection model.
* Try out the new model through the shopping application

From a high-level view each user will have all their required services available in their own unique OpenShift project.

== Shopping Application Components

In our "Art of the Possible" scenario for this lab, we are using an "edge" application to call the image detection model. The application is made up of the following services:


* *shopper* : The shopping application is a Red Hat Camel Quarkus application that provides a GUI for shoppers to take pictures or load pictures of items they want to purchase.  The web based frontend can run on computer or phone web browsers.  This service works with the other services on the edge to identify the product and offer a price back to the shopper.
* *tf-server* :  This is a containerized TensorFlow Serving engine.  In this Lab we are using TensorFlow as our AI framework to build and run models. Although OpenShift AI supports many different frameworks and approaches.  The *tf-service* calls a deployed model that was pushed out to a production S3 Bucket in MinIO.  This service provides *shopper* with image detection inferencing.
* *price-engine* :  This service is a Red Hat CamelK service that is called by shopper to look up pricing for identified product pictures/images. Services like this provide the business logic for making decisons based upon what inferences models make.
* *broker-amq* : Red Hat AMQ Broker running MQTT protocol. This demo can be ramped up into many different configurations and topologies. In many true edge scenarios a message broker running MQTT protocol provides a powerful lightweight approach for IoT scenarios. (MQTT is designed as an extremely lightweight publish/subscribe messaging transport that is ideal for connecting remote devices with a small code footprint and minimal network bandwidth.)
* *minio* : This is an S3 storage system where you can publish your models.  *tf-server* will load and use new and updated models as they are moved into the production S3 bucket.

NOTE: For purposes of supporting a large lab exercise the lab developers have simplified the layout.  Normally the "Edge" tier running the above services would be running on an edge device running on something like Red Hat Device Edge with MicroShift, or Red Hat Single Node Openshift.  The edge (kiosk, store, remote location) would have it's own S3 storage that receives new models and updated models from an MLOps lifecycle that supports GitOps approaches. The edge environment would be either disconnected or partially connected to a central data center or cloud environment where the model building, training, and monitoring occurs. The lab presentors will cover explanations and approaches for more real-world topologies.

== Environment information
For the purposes of this Lab, we have provisioned a single OpenShift cluster, along with all the Application Services Operators and running instances required to complete the module.

=== Red Hat OpenShift DevSpaces
An important Development capability *DevSpaces* has been included with the installation for each user.  DevSpaces provides a powerful Red Hat OpenShift hosted IDE, and its server component runs as a container inside OpenShift. The DevSpaces IDE runs in a web browser providing users with Visual Studio Code as its default visual environment.  Each user in this lab has their own DevSpaces instance.

=== User Credentials

Each person attending this lab will have a unique user account in which to do their work.

If you are using the customized version of the instructions, the information below will render properly. If not, you will see placeholder values instead.

* Your account id: `{user}`
* Your password: `{password}`

=== Log into the OpenShift Console
In a new window or tab, open the following URL and log into OpenShift:

* The Red Hat OpenShift Console login page:
** https://console-openshift-console.apps.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/[https://console-openshift-console.apps.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/]

* Enter your credentials as detailed above (as detailed above)

* After you authenticate, you should be taken into your {user}-lab2-edge project, and the result should look like:
** You need to ensure you are in developer view, and have clicked on the Topology view option as indicated in the screenshot below.
